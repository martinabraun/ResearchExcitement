I am a final year student in the master's program Molecular Bioscience and am working on my master's thesis. Finishing my degree soon also means I am looking for PhD positions. Applying for PhDs naturally confronted me with the question of which research direction I wish to pursue. Additionally, I recently started to focus on bioinformatics and single-cell omics. Therefore, I decided to explore the potential impact of bioinformatics on my excitement for research.  

Side note: Having to write applications on a Sunday in the middle of summer can become so tedious, it leads to sudden bursts of creativity. In this case, the outcome of my application procrastination is a ggplotified interactive version of my CV. I hope you enjoy this little weekend project.
